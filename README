Repository containing code for the paper 

R. McKilliam, R. Subramanian, E. Viterbo, I. V. L. Clarkson. ''On the error performance of the $A_n$ lattices''

The main latex file is paper.tex.

The script build.sh with build the figures and compile the latex file to a pdf using pdflatex.

There are two mathematica scripts for computing the probability of error for the An lattices.  The first is nopolymoments.nb which, when executed will construct a probability of error plot for one of the An lattices.

The file formulan.nb computes formula for the moments by solving the recursion described in the paper.

The plots folder contains the output data and scripts for generating the plot in the paper.  An existing java library was used for the Monte Carlo simlations.  Execute the script 

montecarlo.sh 

You need a working jvm and scala2.8 or higher installed to run this.  These scripts make use of nearest point algorithms for An (and other lattices) contained in the java library available at 

https://github.com/robbymckilliam/pubsim.  

An executable for this library is packaged inside this repository.
